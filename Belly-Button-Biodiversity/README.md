Interactive Visualizations and Dashboards Assignment
This repository contains an assignment for the Interactive Visualizations and Dashboards module. The assignment involves creating an interactive dashboard using the D3 library and the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes found in human navels. The dataset shows that a small number of microbial species are present in the majority of people, while the rest are relatively rare.

Visualizations
The assignment consists of creating several visualizations, including:

A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 microbial species found in an individual. See BarChart and DropDown Button.
A bubble chart showing each sample. See Bubble Chart.
A display of demographic information for each individual. See Demographic Info.
The visualizations should be updated whenever a new sample is selected.

Advanced Challenge (Optional)
An optional advanced challenge involves creating a gauge chart. See Gauge Chart.

Code and Deployment
The code for this assignment can be found in the GitHub repository, and the deployed page can be accessed at GitHub Pages.
